      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Hủ Tiếu is to south Vietnam as Phở is to north Vietnam, and Bún Bò Huế
        is to central Vietnam. It stands out as the most versatile Vietnamese
        noodle soup due to its numerous variations. It can be enjoyed with three
        different types of noodles and customized with an extensive range of
        toppings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dry version of Hủ Tiếu is known as Hủ Tiếu Khô, while a variation
        made with wheat or egg noodles is known as Mì Khô. If you opt for the
        version with a combination of toppings, it may be referred to as Thập
        Cẩm, as in Hủ Tiếu Khô Thập Cẩm or Mì Khô Thập Cẩm depending on the type
        of noodles used.

          This step helps to remove any impurities and ensure a clear broth.
          Rinse the pork bones under cold water and place them in a pot of
          boiling water. Let them boil for 8 minutes, then drain and rinse them
          again.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the yellow onions, dried shrimp, and dried squid on a baking
          tray and roast them in a small toaster oven until aromatic. You can
          also do this the traditional way by placing the onions and dried
          seafood over an open flame until lightly charred on the outside. Scrap
          off any burnt pieces, if any, to prevent darkening the broth.
